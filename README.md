In the name of the creator
This site was created with the aim of showing the true form of the Middle East. And I hope that I will be successful as a developer in this way.
The structure of this site is a sample view of how the project works. The codes are configured in such a way that they can be easily expanded after being transferred to a separate and main server.
The goal is also to reveal the main structure, but for the development and expansion and what I have specified in the progress of the project, we will need to use a dedicated server.
Note that some photos and sections have not been uploaded intentionally. This had two reasons: one, so that the files and photos would not be leaked, and two, technically, the upload at this stage of the project would be very heavy and slow.
I hope you will carefully review all the codes.
